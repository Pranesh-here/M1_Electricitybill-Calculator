**# REQUIREMENTS**

**#INTRODUCTION:** The Electricity Bill calculator project is the application based mini project,      which is used to predict the electricity bill in a monthly basis by taking input of the units totally consumed by all the appliances (Domestic or Commercial Industries). The tool used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code. This project has multi file and multiplatform approach (Linux and Windows).

**#RESEARCH**

**People who don’t have technical knowledge of calculating electricity bill can use this application to predict electricity bill of the present month. However, the defining features of an electricity bill calculator include:**

- domestic or commercial consumer
- checks 4-digit account number
- units consumed per month
- calculates penalty charges (if applicable)

**Defining System:** 

Design and testing operations of electricity bill calculator using unit testing algorithm.

**SWOT analysis:**

**Strengths:** Innovative, User-friendly.

**Weakness**: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth.

Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.
